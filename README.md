# VenetianBlindSim
Venetian blind simulator for KNX actuators with Arduino
Successfully adapted to MDT JAL0210.02
This project uses an Arduino Nano, a Max7219 8x32 LED Matrix.
2 pushbuttons, 6 resistors and 4 LEDs may be used to experiment the project without actually having the KNX actuator
All explenations are in italian, sorry
